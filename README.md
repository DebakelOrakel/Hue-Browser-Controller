<h1 align="center" >The Hue Browser Controller</h1>

## Introduction
The Hue Browser Controller is a website that enables you to control your Philips Hue lighting right from the website. It requires no install of software and runs locally. I other words it is a static website which means it can run independently of a web server and run just as it is stored. This means that if you have downloaded the site you can even control your lighting without a public internet connection.

## Features

### Creating a connection
When you enter the website you will see the login page. Here you can use an existing Philips Hue API connection or create a new connection as seen on the figure below. The program will automatically find the IP of a Philips Hue Bridge connected to the same network as your computer. You can also enter the IP manually this can be found in the hue app. After this the button on the Hue Bridge have to be pressed and then the program will automatically create a connection and you can login.
